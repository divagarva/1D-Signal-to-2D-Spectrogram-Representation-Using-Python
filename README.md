# 1D-Signal-to-2D-Spectrogram-Representation-Using-Python
 This project demonstrates the conversion of a 1D signal, such as a time series, into a 2D representation using a spectrogram. The Python code utilizes scipy.signal.spectrogram to display the signal’s frequency content over time, providing a visual understanding of the signal’s behavior in both domains.
